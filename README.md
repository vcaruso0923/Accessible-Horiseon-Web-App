An updated version of Horiseon's web application that follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

A sidebar includes information about the benefits: lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. The header of the page establishes branding and provides links to each of the pieces of primary content on the page. A common footer is also established.

An updated version of Horiseon's web application that follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. The main content is made of sections defining search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. A sidebar includes information about the benefits: lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. The header of the page establishes branding and provides links to each of the pieces of primary content on the page. A common footer is also established. 

Fixes were applied to accomplish the following: 

WHEN you view the source code
THEN you find semantic HTML elements

WHEN you view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN you find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN you view the image elements
THEN you find accessible alt attributes DONE!!!!

WHEN you view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN you view the title element
THEN you find a concise, descriptive title DONE!!!!!
```
